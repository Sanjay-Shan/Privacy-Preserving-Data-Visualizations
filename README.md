# Privacy-Preserving-Data-Visualizations
This repository is a implementation of the Privacy Preserving Data Visualization journal article presented in the EPJ Data Science category of the SpringerOpen Journal. This was done as a part of my course work "Interactive Data Visualization" at University of Centrl Florida.

## Task given
The task was to consider a peer reviewed research paper, implement the methodologies given in the paper and finally compare the given visualizations with your improvised visualizations.

## Topics covered
1. K-Anonymization technique
2. Deterministic Anonymization
3. Probabilistic Anonymization

## Repository Contents
1. Code Implementation in R - Well commented code for each of the anonymization techniques 
2. Saved images of the plots
3. Presentation - Showcasing the improvised visualizations

## Improvised Visualization
The below section showcases some of the improved methods to showcase plots sideby keeping the crux of the methodology in mind
